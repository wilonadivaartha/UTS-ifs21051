    <string-array name="karakter_dino">
        <item>These were enormous, two-legged predators with the most powerful jaws and teeth of any land animal. They reigned supreme as apex predators during their time. (Examples: Tyrannosaurus Rex, Tarbosaurus,</item>
        <item>The largest land creatures ever to have walked the Earth! These herbivores possessed incredibly long necks, tails, and legs, allowing them to reach and consume vast quantities of foliage. (Examples: Brachiosaurus, Diplodocus, Argentinosaurus)</item>
        <item>Herbivores with a distinctive appearance, these dinosaurs sported bony plates and spikes along their backs, likely for defense. Their brains were relatively small, and their movement was presumably slow. (Examples: Stegosaurus, Kentrosaurus, Dacentrurus)</item>
        <item>Equipped with horns and a bony frill around their necks, these herbivores were well-adapted for grazing. Their powerful jaws could chomp through tough vegetation. (Examples: Triceratops, Centrosaurus, Styracosaurus)</item>
        <item>Heavily armored herbivores, these dinosaurs were like walking tanks with bony plates and spikes covering their entire bodies. Short legs meant they were slow-moving, but their armor provided excellent protection from predators. (Examples: Ankylosaurus, Nodosaurus, Pinacosaurus)</item>
        <item>These fast, bipedal dinosaurs were built for speed with long legs and beaks. They were likely omnivores and may have been capable of incredibly fast running. (Examples: Gallimimus, Ornithomimus, Deinonychus)</item>
        <item>These herbivores had unique duck-billed snouts and crests on their heads. Their powerful jaws allowed them to efficiently eat tough plants. (Examples: Parasaurolophus, Corythosaurus, Edmontosaurus)</item>
        <item>Encompassing a vast and diverse group, this family includes tyrannosaurs, birds, and many other bipedal dinosaurs. Theropods exhibited a range of dietary preferences, with some being carnivores, herbivores, or even omnivores.</item>

    <string-array name="perilaku_dino">
        <item>These fearsome predators likely employed a mix of hunting strategies, acting as both active hunters in packs and opportunistic scavengers. Cannibalism might have also occurred within these groups. Interestingly, some evidence suggests they may have cared for their young.</item>
        <item>Imagine gentle giants roaming in herds! These colossal herbivores likely undertook long migrations to find food and may have communicated using low-frequency sounds inaudible to human ears. Building nests and caring for their young are possibilities based on available evidence.</item>
        <item>Primarily solitary or living in small groups, these herbivores munched on leaves, fruits, and seeds. Their most prominent feature, the spiky tail (thagomizer), served as a formidable defense mechanism. Whether they were active during the day or night remains under debate.</item>
        <item>Safety in numbers! These herbivores found protection in herds while grazing on tough plants. Their horns and elaborate frills functioned for both defense against predators and visual display.  There's a possibility they cooperatively raised their young within the herd.</item>
        <item>Picture heavily armored tanks lumbering across the landscape. Solitary and slow-moving, these herbivores fed on low-growing plants. Their primary defense was their impressive armor, although their activity patterns (day or night) are still being unraveled.</item>
        <item>Built for speed and agility, these dinosaurs were likely adept predators of small animals and insects. They might have lived in flocks, and some theories suggest they potentially built nests and cared for their young.</item>
        <item>Herding provided safety for these herbivores as they grazed on tough plants. Their unique head crests might have been used for communication and display within the herd. Similar to Ceratopsians, they might have exhibited cooperative breeding behavior.</item>
        <item>Encompassing a diverse range of behaviors, theropods included predators, scavengers, and even herbivores. Social structures also varied, with some living in packs and others being solitary. Nest building and parental care likely differed among the various theropod species.</item>
